## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: For backend logic and RAG pipeline.
- **FastAPI**: Lightweight and fast API framework to handle backend requests.
- **Next.js**: Server-rendered React framework used for the frontend.
- **TypeScript**: For robust and scalable frontend development.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was enabling document-based retrieval and ensuring the chatbot responds with reliable, contextual answers. Integrating FAISS with legal embeddings, optimizing query latency, and building a secure video calling feature were technically demanding but rewarding. Managing database using DrizzleORM and NeonDB taught us a lot about scalable serverless architecture. On the frontend, balancing performance and user experience while building secure, client-friendly features was a key learning curve.
